#Blood Drive Data

### The Rundown
 - A user can view stats on donors, blood drive trucks, and particular dates and locations for planned drives.  The user can also view stats for a specific drive if its date has passed and see how many ounces of blood was collected, the location, the date, and the donors.  This is a Java and PostgreSQL project in IntelliJ.
 
### Why I Chose a Blood Drive
 - This was a great opportunity for me to experiment with how my data is structured.  This database can be very useful.  I also wanted to experiment with date time in Java a bit.
 
### Core Work Flow
 - Like any good CRUD, the user goes through various menus of options to do what they want.  A user can create and delete trucks and drives, view the lists of trucks, donors, and drives, and search each by ID.

- Tuesday - Get the database running
- Wednesday - Finish the base CRUD
- Thursday - Implement dates and auto-table creating
- Friday - Present
 
### Utilized Content

- PostgreSQL used to start and update the database
